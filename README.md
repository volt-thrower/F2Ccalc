# F2Ccalc
Simple Fahrenheit to Celsius convertor. Baby's first function :)

Does that it says on the tin. put in a temperature in Fahrenheit, get it back in Celsius
Super simple, nothing special, just playing with making really basic functions.


Just made this to use when developing I'm film.  My old chemical thermometer was a souvenior from the states in Fahrenheit and massive dev chart uses the queens math.
It's probably quicker to just google it though. 


Planning on writing a film development calculator that will work out push development times when you get a bit silly. Most dev charts only top out at 2 stops :(
This will be used as a lil part of it in case you want to enter your temperatures in Fahrenheit while the calculator will uses Celecius like a normal person/robot.
